    <h3 id="mel">MY PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENTS</h3>
    <p style="text-align:center; ">
        From a young age I have been very hardworking and eager to learn new things since
        Knowledge is power and I have achieved alot during the two week Programme.
        I managed to learn HTML,CSS and bootstrap from Samson and I also learned alot
        feom Julie during the leadership lessons it made me look at the world from a 
        different perspective and I have greatly improved in interacting and being
        around people and I have also managed to make friends with my fellow counterparts
        and we discuss and help each other where possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="mel">WHAT SUCESS LOOKS LIKE TO ME</h3>
    <p>
        To me success is not protrayed by the cars someone drives or the house a person lives in but 
        instead success should really be seen as the way people help others not expecting anything in return
        or by people who do things in a win win way and do not only think about themseleves.
        To me success has many ways it can be seen For Example If they say postive things about a personI believe
        that is success in it's own wy,If you help others you also count to be successful since most people
        do not.Lastly success is seen by the way you impact the people around you because they are the ones 
        that give you a helping hand when your stuck and without friends or family it is difficult to make it
        because as the saying goes "Two heads are better then one" so with friends and family the impossible is 
        possible.
