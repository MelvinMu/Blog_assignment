    <p>
        Most work comes with alot of pressure and for you to be able to handle
        you have to be calm and flexible in what your doing so as to get the work
        done.Refactory showed me that I should be willing to work well with people
        and that whenever someone gives an opinion no matter how much I don't like 
        it I should first try to understand it then act accoringly.
