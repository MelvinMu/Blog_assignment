    <p>
        I am going to put in alot of effort and practice very much so as 
        to excel in the programme. I will also ask for help where I do not 
        seem to understand and I will also take part in discussions with
        my peers.
    </p>

    <p>
        I know times will get tough but giving up is not an option if you truly love 
        something no matter how hard it is you will get it done and you will managed
        to excel.Another thing is that I will fully utilize this opportunity that I 
        have gotten to study Software engineering and I will put everything else aside 
        and ensure that I fully focuse on this course.
